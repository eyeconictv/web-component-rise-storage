# Rise Storage Web Component

## Introduction

The Rise Storage Web Component uses Googleâ€™s storage API to retrieve the URLs of all files in a particular folder, or the URL of a single file in a particular folder, from Rise Storage.

See the [component page](http://rise-vision.github.io/web-component-rise-storage/components/web-component-rise-storage/rise-storage/) for more information.

Rise Storage Web Component works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Built With
- Polymer
- Bower
- Mocha and Chai for testing

## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
The component can be installed by executing the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-storage.git
$ cd web-component-rise-storage/rise-storage
$ bower install
```

### Run Local
You can access the `demo.html` file via a local web server. On Mac, use the following
commands:
```
$ cd ..  # You'll want to run the web server from the parent directory.

This starts a web server on port 8000, and you can access the Rise Storage web component by navigating to `localhost:8000/rise-storage/demo.html`.
